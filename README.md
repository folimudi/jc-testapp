This is a Python application that connects WhatsApp and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It allows you to send messages to a WhatsApp number, which are then processed by the bot using GPT-3, and the bot responds with a message generated by the language model.

Setup
To set up this application, you need to:

Install Python 3.x on your computer

Install the required Python packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install twilio flask openai
Create a new Twilio account and get a Twilio phone number

Set up a new WhatsApp Sandbox in your Twilio account

Set up your OpenAI API key and configure the openai package with your API key

Configure the config.py file with your Twilio and OpenAI credentials

Start the Flask server using the following command:

Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask server on localhost:5000.

Use Ngrok or a similar tool to create a public URL for your localhost server so that Twilio can send messages to it.

Usage
To use the WhatsApp-GPT3 bot, send a message to your Twilio phone number on WhatsApp. The bot will process your message using GPT-3 and respond with a message generated by the language model.

You can customize the behavior of the bot by modifying the app.py file. For example, you can change the prompts that are sent to GPT-3 or the way that the responses are formatted.
